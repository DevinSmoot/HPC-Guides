This repository was created to guide others in building a supercomputing cluster on a basic Debian based system. There are three main guides: Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu Server based, and VirtualBox with Ubuntu based.

Raspberry Pi guide uses Raspberry Pi 3b boards with **Raspbian Buster Lite** as the operating system.

Ubuntu Server guide uses **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS** as the operating system.

VM Ubuntu Server guide uses **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS** as the operating system.
